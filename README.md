# Rabtay
Rabtay is an android app that loads a user's contacts (including name, number, and photo) from the Contact Content Provider and saves them in an SQLite database with the help of Room ORM. It then fetches the contacts from the database and binds them in a recycler view. Users can also search for contacts either by their name or number.
